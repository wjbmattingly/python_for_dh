    "An <b>integer</b> is a digit that does not contain a decimal place, i.e. 1 or 2 or 3. This can be a number of any size, such as 100,001,200. A float, on the other hand, is a digit with a decimal place. So, while 1 is an integer, 1.0 is a float. Floats, like integers, can be of any size, but they necessarily have a decimal place, i.e. 200.0020002938. In python, you do not need any special characters to create an integer or float object. You simply need an equal sign. In the example below, we have two objects which are created with a single equal sign. These objects are titled an_integer and a_float with the former being an object that corresponds to the integer 1 and the latter being an object that corresponds to the float 1.1."

What if you want to know the times a specific author wrote to a colleague or to which places he wrote most frequently, as was the case with the Republic of Letters project at Stanford? In order to perform that kind of analysis, you MUST have a command of how numbers work in Python, how to perform basic mathematical functions on those numbers, and how to interact with them. Further, numbers are essential to understand for performing more advanced functions in Python, such as Loops, explored in Chapter 03.01.\n",
