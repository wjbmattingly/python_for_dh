    "In this chapter, we will learn about web scraping, one of the more vital skills of a digital humanist. **Web scraping** is process by which we automate the calling of a server (which hosts a website) and parsing that request which is an HTML file. **HTML** stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the way in which websites are structured. When we scrape a website, we write rules for extracting pieces of information from it based on how that data is structured within the HTML. To be competent at web scraping, therefore, one must be able to understand and parse HTML.\n",

    "So why is HTML useful? HTML, like other markup languages, such as **XML**, or eXstensible Markup Language, allows users to structure data within data. This is achieved by what are known as tags. I think It is best to see what this looks like in practice. Let's examine a simple HTML file.\n",

    "Above, we see a very simple HTML file structure. In the first line of this HTML, we see `<div>`. Note the use of `<` and `>`. The opening `<` indicates the start of a tag in HTML. A **tag** is a way of denoting structure within an HTML file. It is a way of saying that what comes after this nested bit of code is this type of data. After the `<`, we see the word `div`. This word denotes the type of tag that we are using. In this case, we are creating a `div` tag. This is one of the most common types of tags in HTML. After the tag's name, we see `>`. This identifies the end of the tag creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In line 2, we see a nested, or indented bit of HTML. In HTML, unlike Python, indentation is optional. It is, however, good practice to use line breaks and indentation in HTML to make the document easier for humans to parse. Line two begins with a `p` tag. The `p` tag in HTML is used to denote the start of a paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the creation of the `p tag`, we see `This is a paragraph`. In HTML, text that lies outside of the tags is text that appears on the web page. In this case, the HTML file would display the text `This is a paragraph`. Immediately after this bit of text we encounter our first close tag. A `close tag` in HTML indicates that this nested bit of structure is over. In our case, the first close tag is `</p>`. We know that it is a close tag because of the `</`, as opposed to `<`.\n",
