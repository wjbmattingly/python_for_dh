    "**Time series data** is data that reflects either time or dates. In Pandas this type of data is known as datetime. If you are working with time series data, as we shall see, there are significant reasons to ensure that Pandas understands that the data at hand is a date or a time. It allows for easily manipulation and cleaning of inconsistent data formatting. Let us consider a simple example. Imagine we were given dates from one source as 01/02/2002 and another as 01.02.2002. Both are valid date formats, but they are structured entirely differently. Imagine now you had a third dataset that organized the data as 2 January 2002. Your task is to merge all these datasets together.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wanted to do that, you could write out some Python and script them into alignment, but Pandas offers the ability to do that automatically. In order to leverage that ability, however, you must tell Pandas that the data at hand is datetime data. Exactly how you do that, we will learn in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data is important for many different aspects of industry and academia. In the financial sector, time series data allows for one to understand the past performance of a stock. This is particularly useful in machine learning predictions which need to understand the past to predict accurately the future. More importantly, they need to understand the past a sequence of data. In the humanities, time series data is important for understand historical context and, as we shall see, plotting data temporally. Understanding how to work with time series data, therefore, in Pandas is absolutely essential."

    "In this chapter, we will be working with an early version of a dataset I helped cultivate at the *Bitter Aloe Project*, a digital humanities project that explores apartheid violence in South Africa during the 20th century. This dataset comes from Vol. 7 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's *Final Report*. I am using not our final, well-cleaned version of this dataset, rather an earlier version for one key reason. It contains problematic cells and structure. This is more reflective of real-world data, which will often times come from multiple sources and need to be cleaned and structured. As such, it is good practice in this chapter to try and address some of the common problems that you will encounter with time series data."

In this notebook, however, I want to focus on Yr, which is a column that contains a single year referenced within the description. This corresponds to the year in which the violence described occurred. Notice, however, that we have a problem. Year is being recognized as a float (a number with a decimal place), or floating number. To confirm our suspicion, let's take a look at the data types by using the following command."

    "Here, we can see all the different columns and their corresponding data types. Notice that Yr has float64. This confirms our suspicion. Why is this a problem? Well, if we were to try and plot the data by year (see the bar graph below), we would have floating numbers in that graph. This does not look clean. We could manually adjust these years to have no decimal place, but that requires effort on a case-by-case basis. Instead, it is best practice to convert these floats either to integers or to datetime data. Both have their advantages, but if your end goal is larger data analysis on time series data (not just plotting the years), I would opt for the latter. In order to do either, however, we must clean the data to get it into the correct format."
