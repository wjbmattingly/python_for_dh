    "The very first thing that every programmer learns is how to print something off using that programming language. In most tutorials, you will see the phrase \"Hello, World!\" used. In this textbook, let's try something a bit different. Let's say I wanted to print off \"Hello, William\". We can do this in Python by using the **print function**. The print function lets us print off some piece of data. In our case, that piece of data will be a piece of text, known as a string (see below). Our text is \"Hello, William\". The thing that we want to print off must be located between an open parentheses and a close parentheses. Let's try to execute the print command in the cell below."
