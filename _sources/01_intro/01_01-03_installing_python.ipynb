You will learn how to install libraries locally and in a Jupyter Notebook (like those used on Google Colab) later in this part of the textbook. Once the libraries are installed, the entire notebook can be run as if you were running the notebook locally. A downside to Google Colab is its inability to leverage the data found within this textbook. This means that in some cases, you will need to manually upload the data into Google Colab for some notebooks to run as expected.\n",

This means that Binder will take substantially longer to load, but will contain the entire textbook. It will save the instance for a period of time as well so that if you return to the same link in a short period of time, there is a chance it will not have to reinstall all the libraries again.
