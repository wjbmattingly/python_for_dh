    "In the last chapter, I introduced you to the basics of HTML. At the end of the chapter, we saw briefly how that HTML can be used to call a server that holds a website's page and then parse that data. While we did not cover precisely what was happening in the code, all of this was achieved with two libraries that we will meet in this chapter: requests and BeautifulSoup.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <b>requests</b> library allows us to send a signal via Python to server. A good way to think about requests is as an invisible browser that opens in the background of your computer. Requests does the precise thing your browser does. It sends a signal over the internet to connect to a specific server address. While all servers have a unique IP address. Often the internet links a specific and unique address that can be used as a way to connect to a server without having to type out an IP address. Unlike your browser, however, requests does not will up the results for you to see. Instead, it receives the return signal and simply stores the HTML data in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>BeautifulSoup</b> is the second library in this workflow. It allows us to create a unique soup object which converts the HTML into a unique data structure in memory that we can then parse, analyze, and navigate through Python."

    "I recommend learning requests and BeautifulSoup to beginners of web scraping for two reasons. First, they are the simplest libraries to learn in Python. Second, for the vast majority of web scraping tasks, requests and BeautifulSoup will do everything you need. In some circumstances, websites may have robust methods in place to prevent web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "While not covered in this chapter, there are more robust and powerful ways to scrape data with Python, specifically with Selenium. <b>Selenium</b> performs both the functions of requests and BeautifulSoup. Additionally, Selenium allows you to open up a special instance of a browser (typically Chrome or Firefox) and control that browser through Python. When you need to do more sophisticated web scraping, particularly instances where you need to type in a password or scroll down a page or need to imitate a human, Selenium is the method of choice. I will be coming out with a textbook around web scraping in the near future (as of March 2022) that will detail this process in greater detail. For now, I mention it so that you know the limitations of requests and BeautifulSoup and the potential ways to fill their gaps."

    "On the surface, this looks like we may have failed. What is this odd \"response 200\" and what does it mean? This particular response means that our attempt to connect to a server was successful. There are many types of responses, but 200 is the one we want to see. If you ever see a response that is not 200, you can Google the particular server response and you will find out what is happening. Sometimes, a response indicates that your request was blocked. This may be because the website has anti-web scraping measures in place. In other cases, the page may be protected, meaning that it lies behind a login. There are too many potential errors that may surface that I cannot detail them all in this basic introduction chapter. I will, however, give you a solution to a very common problem that can allow you to get around a common 403 response. For that solution, check out the final section of this chapter."
