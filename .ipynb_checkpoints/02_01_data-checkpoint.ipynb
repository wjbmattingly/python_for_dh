    "When we import or create data within Python, we are essentially creating an object, or a variable. These two words mean slightly different things and, but are often used interchangeably. We will get into the differences later in this textbook, but for now, view an object as something that is created by a Python script. An object is stored in your computer's memory so that it can be used later in a program. Think of your computer's memory rather like your own brain. Imagine if you needed to remember what the word for \"hello\" in German. You may use your memory rather like a flashcard, where \"hello\" in English equates to \"hallo\" in German. In Python, we create objects in a similar way so that our computer understands what that object name corresponds to.\n",

(We will learn about these in more detail below.) In my case, I want to create the object author. I want author to be associated with my name in memory.

Later in this textbook we will do more advanced things with strings using third-party libraries, such as Regex, but for now, we will simply work with the basic functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although I will discuss functions in greater detail in a later lesson, it is important to understand what a function is. A function is a block of code stored outside (or inside) your Python script. We call a function by using the function name and added an open and a close parentheses. Often when we call functions, we need to pass arguments. These are the pieces of data that the function will perform the operations on. The arguments are contained within the parentheses and delineated with commas. In some cases, there will be named arguments which require you to specify a specific argument.\n",

In the example we state the object upon which we want to perform the function. Next, we place a period to state the specific function that we want to run on the string. We have an open parentheses in which we have a single argument, a string (created by quotation marks). The specific string is a single comma. This means that we are telling Python to split the string any time it finds a comma. Remember though, strings are immutable. This means that in order to store the result of this function in memory, we need to create a new object. This new object is new_string which we create with an equal sign. Were we to print off new string, we would see a list of strings that would look like this: [“Hello”,”Bye”]. To run the code below, hit the play button.\n",

Each is separated by a comma. The first argument is the substring or piece of the string that you want to replace and the second argument is what you want to replace it with. Why is this so useful? If you are using Python to analyze texts, those texts will, I promise, never be well-cleaned. They may have bad encoding, characters that will throw off searches, bad OCR, multiple line breaks, hyphenated characters, the list goes on. Replace allows you to quickly and effectively clean textual data so that it can be standardized.\n",

What if you want to know the times a specific author wrote to a colleague or to which places he wrote most frequently, as was the case with the Republic of Letters project at Stanford? In order to perform that kind of analysis, you MUST have a command of how numbers work in Python, how to perform basic mathematical functions on those numbers, and how to interact with them. Further, numbers are essential to understand for performing more advanced functions in Python, such as Loops, explored in Lesson 09.\n",
