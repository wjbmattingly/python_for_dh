    "Word vectors, or word embeddings, are numerical representations of words in multidimensional space through matrices. The purpose of the word vector is to get a computer system to understand a word. Computers cannot understand text efficiently. They can, however, process numbers quickly and well. For this reason, it is important to convert a word into a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial methods for creating word vectors in a pipeline take all words in a corpus and convert them into a single, unique number. These words are then stored in a dictionary that would look like this: {\"the\": 1, \"a\", 2} etc. This is known as a **bag of words**. This approach to representing words numerically, however, only allow a computer to understand words numerically to identify unique words. It does not, however, allow a computer to understand *meaning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom loves to eat chocolate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom likes to eat chocolate.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sentences represented as a numerical array (list) would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n",
    "\n",
    "1, 6, 3, 4, 5\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, as humans both sentences are nearly identical. The only difference is the degree to which Tom appreciates eating chocolate. If we examine the numbers, however, these two sentences seem quite close, but their semantical meaning is impossible to know for certain. How similar is 2 to 6? The number 6 could represent \"hates\" as much as it could represent \"likes\". This is where word vectors come in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word vectors take these one dimensional bag of words and gives them multidimensional meaning by representing them in higher dimensional space, noted above. This is achieved through machine learning and can be easily achieved via Python libraries, such as Gensim, which we will explore more closely in the next notebook."

It can look up synonyms and then know what words mean. This approach, on the surface, makes perfect sense, but let's explore that option and see why it cannot possibly work.\n",
