    "Libraries are common across all programming languages. They allow you to import large amounts of code that contain functions and classes that you can leverage in your own code. A good way to think about a library is as the old expression: \"don't reinvent the wheel\". Use what others have done! Open-source is open for a reason! People who make these libraries do it so that you don't have to solve certain problems. They've done it for you.\n",
