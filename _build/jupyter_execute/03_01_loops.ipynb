    "Loops are a fundamental concept in all programming languages. They are essential in nearly every piece of code that I write and my experience is far from unique. Loops are essential because they allow you to systematically iterate over data. <b>Iteration</b> is the process by which you move across a piece of data or collection of data. As we will learn in this chapter, there are two types of loops in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For Loops\n",
    "2. While Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "While most tasks can be achieved with either loop, the way in which you use them is different. By the end of this chapter, you will understand not only how to construct a loop in Python, but have a general idea about when to use which loop. As you code more and more, you will learn that coders tend to favor one type of loop over the other. For me (pun intended), I prefer the for loop. If you asked me why, I could not give you an answer. Maybe by the end of this chapter, you will have a favorite as well!"

This word \"namelist\" corresponds to the object name that I want to iterate over. Finally there is a \":\". In Python, this is the way that we note a nested portion of code.
