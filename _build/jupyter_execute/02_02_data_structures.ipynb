    "In the last chapter, we met strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Each of these were types of data. Strings, for example, allowed us to work with text and numbers allowed us to work with integers and floats. In this chapter, we will begin working with data structures. <b>Data structures</b> are ways of storing multiple kinds of data in a systematic way. In Python, these are created as objects that can be stored in memory and called later in a script. They are divided into two categories: mutable and immutable. We encountered these terms in the last chapter, but we will explore what they mean in more depth below.\n",

    "Throughout this chapter, we will learn about some of the key types of data structures, how they are different, and how they can be used. We will only cover these in a cursory manner. Throughout this textbook, we will use these data structures to write code and perform data cleaning and data analysis tasks. It is essential that you know how to recognize types of data structures and differentiate them before moving forward. To keep things simple for now, we will focus on three types of data structures: lists, tuples, and dictionaries. There are other types of data structures in Python, but these are the core three that you will use."

We can distinguish tuples from lists by the way in which they are formed. While lists use square brackets, tuples use parentheses. We create a tuple, like the example below. Our tuple object is a_tuple and the tuple consist of three items: an integer 1, a float 1.0, and a string of “one”. Lists and tuples can contain all three of these types of data.

You will learn about arguments later when we discuss functions and methods in greater depth. For now, understand that the information passed between the parentheses tells the method or function what is needed to perform the function. In this case, .append() allows us to append, or add, something to a list. The argument that we pass, \"one\", tells what we want to append. In this case, the string, \"one\"."
